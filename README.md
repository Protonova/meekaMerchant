Features
----------
This addon checks your gear to see if you need repairs whenever you open a merchant window that allows repairing. Automatically repairing from your pockets or the guild's bank money. 

The addon is very small and takes up virtually no UI space since it has no GUI, libs, or dependencies.

If you hold down `SHIFT` while opening the vendor the addon will temporarily disable itself. Allowing you to manually repair which ever way you desire.
